-- # Recettes de chaque restaurant

-- SQLite seems to rely on Oracle conventions, and as such MySQL exclusive features are not available. (FORMAT, CONCAT, ...)
-- Makes sense given the Java-esque look of their Browser app.
-- As such, formatting neither columns nor entries seems possible in a purely visual manner ;
-- One has to edit the data directly which leads to certain impossibilites, such as ORDERing entries to which a string was appended,
-- or calling a column by its initial name.
